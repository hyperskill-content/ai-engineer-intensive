### FAQ

- How much time should I dedicate each week?
    
    Around 10 hours per week — that’s usually enough to complete the core projects and keep up with the pace.
    
- What if I’m stuck or feel like I’m falling behind?
    
    That’s totally normal — learning something new is *supposed* to feel challenging. Don’t go it alone. Message your mentor or ask in the community chat — we’re here to help, unblock, and cheer you on. You’re not alone in this.
